This measure is an estimate of the number of people in food insecure households.  The brief providing the methodology of calculating these estimates is available at Feeding America's Map the Meal Gap website (linked below). Food insecure households are not necessarily food insecure all the time. Food insecurity may reflect a household's need to make trade-offs between important basic needs, such as housing or medical bills, and purchasing nutritionally adequate foods.",
