Food insecurity refers to USDA's measure of lack of access, at times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members and limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods. Food insecure children are those children living in households experiencing food insecurity. Food-insecure households are not necessarily food insecure all the time. Food insecurity may reflect a household's need to make trade-offs between important basic needs, such as housing or medical bills, and purchasing nutritionally adequate foods.","statement":"The population of food insecure children in {features.name} is {value}.","equity_category":"Status","sources":[{"name":"Feeding America","date_accessed":"2021","url":"https://www.feedingamerica.org/"}],"citations":{},"layer":{}}},{"name":"health_literacy_estimates:health_literacy_estimate","duplicates":18826,"time_range":[10,10],"type":"float","missing":18317,"mean":0.2479,"sd":0.5128,"min":-1.995,"max":3.005,"info":{"category":"Education","measure_table":"dc_education_training.va_hdcttr_sdad_2019_health_literacy_estimates","full_name":"health_literacy_estimates:health_literacy_estimate","measure":"health_literacy_estimate","type":"index","short_name":"Health literacy composite","long_name":"Health literacy composite","short_description":"Health literacy composite captures the adult population's ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health services to make appropriate health decisions","long_description":"The health literacy composite captures the adult population's ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health services to make appropriate health decisions.

Food insecurity refers to USDA's measure of lack of access, at times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members and limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods. Food insecure children are those children living in households experiencing food insecurity. Food-insecure households are not necessarily food insecure all the time. Food insecurity may reflect a household's need to make trade-offs between important basic needs, such as housing or medical bills, and purchasing nutritionally adequate foods.","statement":"The population of food insecure children in {features.name} is {value}.","equity_category":"Status","sources":[{"name":"Feeding America","date_accessed":"2021","url":"https://www.feedingamerica.org/"}],"citations":{},"layer":{}}},{"name":"health_literacy_estimates:health_literacy_estimate","duplicates":51,"time_range":[-1,-1],"type":"unknown","missing":52,"info":{"category":"Education","measure_table":"dc_education_training.va_hdcttr_sdad_2019_health_literacy_estimates","full_name":"health_literacy_estimates:health_literacy_estimate","measure":"health_literacy_estimate","type":"index","short_name":"Health literacy composite","long_name":"Health literacy composite","short_description":"Health literacy composite captures the adult population's ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health services to make appropriate health decisions","long_description":"The health literacy composite captures the adult population's ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health services to make appropriate health decisions.
